                Monkey D. Luffy is the series' main protagonist, a young pirate who wishes to succeed Gol D. Roger, the deceased King of the Pirates, by finding his treasure, the "One Piece". Throughout the series, Luffy gathers himself a diverse crew, named the Straw Hat Pirates, including:

                revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes.
